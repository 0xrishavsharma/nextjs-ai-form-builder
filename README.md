# Next.js AI Form Builder

## Description

This project is a form builder powered by Next.js 14 and OpenAI. It uses Drizzle as an ORM, Tailwind for styling, Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and linting, and TypeScript for static type checking. The component library used is Shadcn, and Zod is used for input validation. The database is PostgreSQL, hosted on Supabase which is also used as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). Authentication is handled by Auth.js. Git hooks are managed with Husky.

This project was inspired by a tutorial from Webdecoded on YouTube. You can watch the tutorial [here](#) (replace with the actual link to the video).
